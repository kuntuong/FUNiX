    <h3>The Origins</h3>
    <p>Some people thought that it came from bats, some say it came from rats. The most recent studies, however, shows that the origin of the virus was most possibly from pangolins, an ant-eater. Some theories even say that the virus was created in a lab.
        The government purposedly hired the scientists to create a new virus to weaken the other countries economies.</p>
