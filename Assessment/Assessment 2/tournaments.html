    <h2>World Cups</h2>
    <p>World cups are cups that are held by FIFA. There will be 32 teams in the world cup. Before each world cup, there will be a qualifiers tournament held in each continent, seperately. Then, the top 4 or 3 of those continents will qualify for the world
        cup. World cups are held every 4 years. The host of the world cups do not need to be in the qualifers round because they are automatically in the World Cup. The country that has won the most world cups is Brazil with 5 world cup wins.
