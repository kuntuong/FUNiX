    <h2>Rules & Regulations</h2>
    <p>A game of soccer/football is played on a grass pitch with 2 goals at each end of the pitch. There will be two teams, each with 11 players. Their objectives are to score as much goals as possible at the other end's goal as possible in 90 minutes. There
        are 4 main positions: the goalkeeper (stands by the goal, blocks the balls from entering the goal), defender (stands at the back, defends the ball from entering the box), midfielder (stands at the middle, passes to the strikers to create chances),
        strikers (stand at the other side of the field, tries to score). The goalkeeper is the only one that can use their hands. When the goal goes out on the sides, you can a throw-in for the other team if your teammate or you was the last one to touch
        it.
